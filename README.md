# 🎬 Image Similarity Search for Movie Recommendation

This Python project implements an image-based similarity search system designed to recommend movies based on visual similarity. It extracts features from movie poster images and finds similar movies using deep learning and computer vision techniques.

## 🧠 What It Does

- Extracts image features using pretrained CNN models (ResNet50)
- Builds a feature vector database from movie posters
- Performs similarity searches based on a given movie poster
- Recommends visually similar movies based on poster aesthetics

## 📁 Project Structure

- `ImageSimilaritySearch.ipynb`: Main notebook containing feature extraction, model training, and similarity logic
- `posters/`: Directory of movie poster images (optional – depends on your local setup)
- `features/`: Precomputed image feature vectors (optional)

##This project is intended as a concept demo and may require tuning or adjustments for full deployment.
